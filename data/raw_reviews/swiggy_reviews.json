I ordered 3 servings of hakka noodles on discount, paid for it. received only one, and after delivery, even the app showed that I ordered 1 instead of 3. There was no option to contact the restaurant, and even the report was showing I ordered 1 serving. thanks for scamming so brilliantly swiggy. Edit: The issue wasn't resolved via email support. Response was generic (please recheck) despite clear explanation. Disappointing experience",

Zomato typically delivers food within 15 minutes, whereas Swiggy takes an hour for the same destination and has higher prices than other delivery apps.

The delivery partner rejected for delivery and they assigned a new delivery partner who was 6 km far from the pickup point. my food delivered in 1 and half hour, totally cold food, no refund was given. So pissed with this kind of service",

Prices are extremely inflated compared to restaurant rates, and on top of that there are multiple extra charges—delivery fee, platform fee, surge fee—making even a simple order overpriced. The value for money is gone. Discounts are misleading and rarely make a real difference. What used to be convenient now feels exploitative. Definitely reconsidering using Swiggy.",

When I called the restaurant, they claimed the food was already picked up by the delivery guy, while the app still showed “preparing.” Clearly misleading and completely unprofessional. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and extremely frustrating.",

Their new christmas tree offer gives you 750 rs in dinecash which they say can be used upto 500rs in one place. However in the faqs in fine print a new reality is unearthed which i ly lets you use only 5percent discount in dinecash or upto 200 rs. Please keep this in mind before dining in on this offer .",
